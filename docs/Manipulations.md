# Manipulations

As the name says manipulations are manipulated versions of the original file. Basically a set of versions of an image, thumbnails, cropped images, flipped images. Or in the case of videos different resolutions quality.

A manipulation must have a name by which is identified. This is important to explicitly (re-) generate a specific version.
