# Variants

> **Variant**: something that is slightly different from other similar things

Variants are modified versions of an original file or additional files. For example an image can have a set of thumbnails in different sizes. A video could have different resolutions or a set of preview images.

A variant **must** have a name by which is identified. This is important to explicitly (re-) generate a specific variant.

**[Processors](Processors.md)** are used to create variants.
